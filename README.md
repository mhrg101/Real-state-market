Description and analysis of the project and the tasks carried out during the internship.

As a data analyst intern in the project to identify trends and opportunities in the real estate market of Quebec at Ecole Efficace, my mission was to support the Head of Career Development & Industry Integration department by conducting data analysis and providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making. Throughout the internship, I had the following responsibilities:

Mission and Responsibilities:
Analyzing real estate market data to identify trends, patterns, and potential opportunities for students' career paths.
Collaborating with the department head and other team members to understand project objectives and align data analysis with the department's goals.
Presenting data-driven insights and recommendations in a clear and concise manner to support the development of effective career development strategies.

Tasks Performed:
Collecting real estate market datasets from various sources, including government agencies, industry reports, and online platforms.
Cleaning and preprocessing data to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.
Utilizing statistical techniques and data visualization tools to analyze and interpret the data effectively.

Files Entrusted:
I had access to datasets related to the real estate market of Quebec, which included information on property prices, market trends, housing demand, and economic indicators relevant to the industry.

Specific Objectives:
The main objective of the project was to identify key trends and opportunities in the real estate market that could inform career development strategies for students interested in pursuing careers in this sector. This involved examining factors such as the most in-demand roles, emerging job opportunities, and geographic areas with significant real estate market growth potential.

Equipment Used:
Personal computer and laptop with sufficient processing power and storage capacity for data analysis tasks.
Internet access to collect data from various online sources and access relevant research materials.

Software and Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets for data cleaning and basic analysis.
Python programming language with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for advanced data analysis and visualization.
Power BI for visualization.
PDF and Microsoft Word for reports.

Tools and Development Method for the Project:
The project was mainly conducted using Python programming for extract and forecast data and Power BI for visualizations. I followed an iterative and exploratory data analysis approach, allowing flexibility in data exploration and hypothesis testing. By using Python's powerful libraries, I could efficiently process large datasets and create meaningful visualizations to identify trends and patterns in the real estate market.

Results:
- Data Analysis: I collected, cleaned, and analyzed datasets related to the real estate market, focusing on property prices, market trends, and economic indicators. Using Python 
  programming and data visualization libraries, I generated visual representations of key trends and patterns.
- I created comprehensive visual presentations that highlighted significant trends in the real estate market. These insights were showcased through graphs, charts, and explanatory notes, 
  making complex data easily understandable for non-technical stakeholders.
- Despite a still weak real estate market, real estate activity intensified in July, marking the strongest performance since the beginning of the year. Compared to June, the data shows a 
  13.2 percentage point increase in sales and nearly a 15-percentage point increase in mortgages.
  Year-to-date from January, property sales have dropped by 30.7%, and mortgages by 30.9%.

  For the entire Quebec region:

- The number of registered sales in July 2023 decreased by 15.8% compared to July 2022.
- Property transfers totaled 21,124, reflecting an 11.7% decrease.
- The number of mortgages also declined by 12.7%.
- The financial difficulties index increased by 46.1%, primarily due to a 63.2% rise in exercise notices, totaling 434 notices registered in July, and an 85.7% increase in bankruptcies,    totaling 13 registered bankruptcies.
 -Compared to July 2019, the pre-pandemic baseline year, sales have decreased by 15.6%, and mortgages have decreased by 8.8%.

  At the regional level:
  - A decrease in the number of sales was observed in all regions except for the North Coast region, which experienced a 1.1% increase.
